* 3.0.3 - in Subversion HEAD

* 3.0.2 - public release, March 23, 2010
 - Defdoc now provides a system asdf-defdoc, which defines a base ASDF
   system for more conveniently associating a system with the
   documents to be generated when loading it.  This system should be
   considered an alpha release and subject to significant change; see
   the trac tickets under the "Documentation" component for an
   indication of how we see this feature evolving.
 - Ticket 197: started an HTML backend for DefDoc.  Doesn't really
   work well at this point.
 - Added three criterion.  All three should be considered in alpha
   testing: feedback is welcome; when we commit to a final form for
   these criteria, we'll roll up the minor version number.
    - A :process criterion for simple interleaving of Lisp function
      calls and NST checks, to allow checking of intermediate states
      of an arbitrarily-long process.  Not yet fully debugged; certain
      errors will about the criterion check, but should be caught and
      counted.
    - Added criteria :applying-common-criterion and
      :with-common-criterion, both of which allow multiple
      applications of one criterion to several data sets to be
      expressed within one single test.
 - Ticket 226: Added a crude workaround to CLisp's stack overflow
   issue --- but not sure how this hack will react in all cases where
   a dispatched test fails.
 - Tickets 185 and 186: A longstanding code quality issue --- I'd like
   to get rid of uses of ~{ , ~[ , ~< and ~* (with or without uses of
   prefix arguments) in calls to format.  They're convenient, but just
   too hard to read in long-term code.  Ticket 185 removes all but the
   simplest uses of the formatters, or their uses in simple-errors.
   Ticket 186 allows a particular internal structure which previously
   stored a format string can now also accept a function on the
   arguments to be formatted.
 - Ticket 215: Small change to this test.
 - Moved from using #' to named-function, which is useful for
   debugging on some platforms, and which NST macro-alises to
   (function ...) on others.
 - Reworked the internal organization of the XUnit output generator.
 - This document is now in Emacs Org-mode format.
 - We now check for compatibility across (most of) the platforms we
   try to support using Jenkins instead of the previous home-grown
   script.
 - Considerable streamlining of documentation.

* 3.0.1 - public release, December 29, 2010
 - Execution of one group can now be triggered by another group, as a
   (directed) hierarchy of groups.
 - Ticket 220: The new setup etc. hooks on fixtures were working only
   for attachment to groups, not to tests.
 - Ticket 223: Spurious warnings from :sample criterion, and a
   facility for adding declaration for a :sample's :where form.
 - Ticket 217: Change included in this release.
 - The def-criterion values lambda list argument can now be the simple
   symbol :ignore, which indicates that
 - Several SBCL style warnings cleared, a number of which arose from
   malformed format strings.
 - Documentation and defdoc improvements.

* 3.0.0 - public release, October 11, 2010
 - This release was planned as 2.1.2, but contains enough extensions
   to the API macros to justify bumping the major release, to allow
   the new API to be required e.g. by ASDF.
 - Improved some of the test output.
 - Fixed a bug in some of the self-test criteria (which had obviously
   never yet come into use).
 - Removed some of the verbosity on recursively-called self-tests.
 - Ticket 212: Correct some duplicate execution of tests.
 - Ticket 189: Allow packages to be omitted from :report and :detail.
 - Documentation tickets: #192, #193, #210.
 - Consolidate the :uses and :assumes options to def-fixtures into the
   single, clearer option :special.  Old options still allowed for now
   but deprecated.
 - Ticket 187: Removed some deprecated internal names.
 - Added a new documentation system for generating common text of the
   docstrings, manual and reference card: #161, #194, #195.

* 2.1.1 - public release, August 31, 2010
 - Fixed a bug in the implementation of fixture sets exporting names
   into their packages, and added tests to verify exporting
   (ticket:163).
 - Added startup/finish hooks for tests, all hooks for fixtures.
 - Verified fix for ticket:129.
 - Many small code-cleaning patches, and some additional unit tests.
 - Updates to the manual and quick-reference sheet.

* 2.1.0 - public release, July 1, 2010
 - A fairly significant change to the translation of groups and tests.
   - Will require re-compiling code built against macros from earlier
     NST versions.
   - Should expand to considerably fewer method definitions.
   - Should also clear most of the warnings previously generated under
     SBCL.
 - Added an interactive method to remove groups and tests.
 - Fixed a bug in the parsing when the :export-names and related
   options in fixtures are used.
 - Now explicitly depends on sb-aclrepl in SBCL; thanks to Stelian
   Ionescu for pointing out the implicit dependency in earlier
   version.
 - Correct the format string used for printing Lisp warnings in NST
   results output; thanks to Steve Harp for pointing out the problem.
 - Added make-success-report, make-failure-report and
   make-warning-report as eventual replacements for emit-success et
   al., per a suggestion of Robert Goldman --- these functions do not
   have any side-effect, so the make-* names more accurately evoke
   their functionality.  We'll eventually deprecate, and then remove,
   the emit-* definitions.

* 2.0.3 - public release, April 6, 2010
 - Renamed the version numbering from 1.3.* to 2.0.*, to allow
   projects to require a version from before the rewrite of criteria
   handling.
 - LispWorks compatibility.
 - Ticket 28 - nil can now be used as a fixture name, to provide
   side-effects in sequence with fixture bindings.
 - Various documentation strings.

* 1.3.2 (2.0.2) - public release, March 16, 2010
 - Improvements/debugging to error reporting.
 - def-test and def-test-group now accept docstrings.
 - Ticket 159 - Quote attribute value string contents in JUnit XML output.
 - Ticket 113 - The last task for :whatis --- this command now reports
   on NST-relevant name in all packages, not just *package*.
 - Ticket 41 - Restored the :debug-on-fail mode.

* 1.3.1 (2.0.1) - public release, February 22, 2010
 - Ticket 158 - The underlying problem was that the internal function
   for constructing a report on all results by package was faulty.
   The function was referencing a deprecated defvar which was no
   longer being written.
 - Added checking of JUnit XML generation to the multiplatform testing suite.
 - Changed the packaging of tests' internal class names for Allegro 8.2.

* 1.3.0 (2.0.0) - public release
 - Ticket 110 - The major fix in this release.  The implementation of
   criteria has been completely rewritten to use method dispatch
   rather than macro expansion.  The def-form-criterion macro is
   invalidated; the def-values-criterion is deprecated.

 - Added the `:nst apply` command to the runtime system.
 - Correct handling of negative numbers in sampling of real numbers.

 - Ticket 149 - Lisp warnings are now caught, and translated into NST
   warnings.

 - Ticket 123 - Bug in output.
 - Reorganized "meta" tests to better examine and regression-test
   NST's performance in detail.

 - Several minor tweaks.

* 1.2.4 - internal release, October 9, 2009
 - Add restarts for use in interactive operation.
 - (Start to) capture fixture names when errors arise in fixture application.
 - Better failure checking of cleanup operations.
 - Added :export-* options to fixtures.
