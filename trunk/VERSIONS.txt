3.0.1 - 
 Execution of one group can now be triggered by another group, as a 
   (directed) hierarchy of groups.
 Ticket 220: The new setup etc. hooks on fixtures were working only for
   attachment to groups, not to tests.
 Documentation and defdoc improvements.

3.0.0 - public release, October 11, 2010
 This release was planned as 2.1.2, but contains enough extensions to
   the API macros to justify bumping the major release, to allow the
   new API to be required e.g. by ASDF.
 Improved some of the test output.
 Fixed a bug in some of the self-test criteria (which had obviously
   never yet come into use).
 Removed some of the verbosity on recursively-called self-tests.
 Ticket 212: Correct some duplicate execution of tests.
 Ticket 189: Allow packages to be omitted from :report and :detail.
 Documentation tickets: #192, #193, #210.
 Consolidate the :uses and :assumes options to def-fixtures into the single,
   clearer option :special.  Old options still allowed for now but deprecated.
 Ticket 187: Removed some deprecated internal names.
 Added a new documentation system for generating common text of the docstrings,
   manual and reference card: #161, #194, #195.

2.1.1 - public release, August 31, 2010
 Fixed a bug in the implementation of fixture sets exporting names into their
   packages, and added tests to verify exporting (ticket:163).
 Added startup/finish hooks for tests, all hooks for fixtures.
 Verified fix for ticket:129.
 Many small code-cleaning patches, and some additional unit tests.
 Updates to the manual and quick-reference sheet.

2.1.0 - public release, July 1, 2010
 A fairly significant change to the translation of groups and tests.
  - Will require re-compiling code built against macros from earlier
    NST versions.
  - Should expand to considerably fewer method definitions.
  - Should also clear most of the warnings previously generated under SBCL.
 Added an interactive method to remove groups and tests.
 Fixed a bug in the parsing when the :export-names and related options in
   fixtures are used.
 Now explicitly depends on sb-aclrepl in SBCL; thanks to Stelian Ionescu for
   pointing out the implicit dependency in earlier version.
 Correct the format string used for printing Lisp warnings in NST
   results output; thanks to Steve Harp for pointing out the problem.
 Added make-success-report, make-failure-report and make-warning-report as
   eventual replacements for emit-success et al., per a suggestion of Robert
   Goldman --- these functions do not have any side-effect, so the make-*
   names more accurately evoke their functionality.  We'll eventually
   deprecate, and then remove, the emit-* definitions.

2.0.3 - public release, April 6, 2010
 Renamed the version numbering from 1.3.* to 2.0.*, to allow
   projects to require a version from before the rewrite of 
   criteria handling.
 LispWorks compatibility.
 Ticket 28 - nil can now be used as a fixture name, to provide
             side-effects in sequence with fixture bindings.         
 Various documentation strings.

1.3.2 (2.0.2) - public release, March 16, 2010
 Improvements/debugging to error reporting.
 def-test and def-test-group now accept docstrings.
 Ticket 159 - Quote attribute value string contents in JUnit XML output.
 Ticket 113 - The last task for :whatis --- this command now reports on
              NST-relevant name in all packages, not just *package*.
 Ticket 41 - Restored the :debug-on-fail mode.

1.3.1 (2.0.1) - public release, February 22, 2010
 Ticket 158 - The underlying problem was that the internal function for
              constructing a report on all results by package was faulty.
              The function was referencing a deprecated defvar which was
              no longer being written.
 Added checking of JUnit XML generation to the multiplatform testing suite.
 Changed the packaging of tests' internal class names for Allegro 8.2.

1.3.0 (2.0.0) - public release
 Ticket 110 - The major fix in this release.  The implementation of
              criteria has been completely rewritten to use method
              dispatch rather than macro expansion.  The
              def-form-criterion macro is invalidated; the
              def-values-criterion is deprecated.
 Added optional caching of fixtures.
 Added the `:nst apply` command to the runtime system.
 Correct handling of negative numbers in sampling of real numbers.
 Ticket 151 - The criteria definers now all allow docstrings.
 Ticket 149 - Lisp warnings are now caught, and translated into
              NST warnings.
 Ticket 60 - Added a with-fixtures macro.
 Ticket 12 - Ctrl-C under SBCL interrupts tests, no longer swallowed.
 Ticket 101 - Separate group setup/cleanup routines within and without
              group fixture bindings

1.2.8 - public release
 The package argument to :nst :run-package is now optional, with
      *package* as default.
 Bug fix for Mac OSX: suppress backtrace collection.

1.2.7 - public release, November 15, 2009
 Ticket 4 - Handling of cleanup group forms, and both setup- and
            cleanup forms attached to individual tests.
 Ticket 140 - NST was not resetting the list of a fixture set's bound
              names on a redefinition of the fixture set.
 Adjusting some type usage in the sample generator for portability.

1.2.6 - public release, November 11, 2009
 Minor bug fixes and improvements.

1.2.5 - internal release, October 28, 2009
 Ticket 134 - Fixed a bug in the :permute criteria.
 Ticket 123 - Bug in output.
 Reorganized "meta" tests to better examine and regression-test NST's
   performance in detail.
 Allow tests to be defined separately from their group.
 Replaced check-result with emit-success.
 Improved deprecation warnings.
 Several minor tweaks.

1.2.4 - internal release, October 9, 2009
 Add restarts for use in interactive operation.
 (Start to) capture fixture names when errors arise in fixture application.
 Better failure checking of cleanup operations.
 Added :export-* options to fixtures.

1.2.3 - internal release, October 2, 2009
 Added :export-names, :export-fixture-name and :export-bound-names to
   the def-fixtures macro.

1.2.2 - internal release, September 9, 2009
 Ticket 104 - recompilation of a test now removes the record of its
              pass/failure.
 Ticket 113 - about halfway implemented.
 Ticket 119 - partial fix: affected tests do now show up as erring,
              although the message is cryptic.
 Start of NST API documentation in manual.

1.2.1 - internal release, September 2, 2009
 Ticket 104 - fixed issues with modern/classic capitalization, occasional
              hanging in backtrace collector

1.2.0 - public release, July 22, 2009
 Deprecation warnings on several disused macros.
 Clarified error output message for :eq/:eql/:equal/:equalp.
 Ticket 98 - customizable meaning for ":nst :debug" via ASDF.
 Ticket 99 - fixed Makefile for documentation.
 Ticket 100 - re-activated links in generated PDF.
 Ticket 102 - deactivated Allegro backtrace harvesting on Mac OS X.
 Ticket 103 discussion - now using "import" for ":nst :open".
 New criterion for quickcheck-style sampling of generated data.
 New do-what-I-mean interactive command :nst :run.
 Code improvements for compile/load-time improvements.
