1.3.3 - 
 LispWorks compatibility.
 Ticket 28 - nil can now be used as a fixture name, to provide
             side-effects in sequence with fixture bindings.

1.3.1 - public release, February 22, 2010
 Ticket 158 - The underlying problem was that the internal function for
              constructing a report on all results by package was faulty.
              The function was referencing a deprecated defvar which was
              no longer being written.
 Added checking of JUnit XML generation to the multiplatform testing suite.
 Changed the packaging of tests' internal class names for Allegro 8.2.

              def-values-criterion is deprecated.
 Added optional caching of fixtures.
 Added the `:nst apply` command to the runtime system.
 Correct handling of negative numbers in sampling of real numbers.
