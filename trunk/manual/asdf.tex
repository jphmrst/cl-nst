Try something like the following, where \texttt{PACKAGE} is where
your code lives, and \texttt{test-PACKAGE} is where your tests on that
code live.\index{ASDF}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmethod perform ((op test-op)
                    (system (eql (find-system :test-PACKAGE))))
  (eval (list (intern (symbol-name '#:run-nst-commands)
                      (find-package :sift.nst))
              :run-package
              (quote (intern (symbol-name 'PACKAGE)
                             (find-package 'cl-user))))))
