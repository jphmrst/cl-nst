  (NAME FORM))

Associate names to values.  One or more fixtures may be applied to each test
group, test or another fixture.  None of the keyword options are manditory.

uses - fixtures whose names are assumed to be bound --- although not necessarily
by those same fixtures --- whenever this fixture is used.

assumes - names assumed to be bound at the point of any use of this fixture.

inner - list of declarations to be made inside the let-binding of names of any
use of this fixture.  Do not include the \"declare\" keyword here; NST adds
these declarations to others, including a special declaration of all bound
names.

documentation - a documentation string for the fixture set.

outer - list of declarations to be made outside the let-binding of names of any
use of this fixture.
