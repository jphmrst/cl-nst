\section*{Overview}
This document is the manual and users' guide to the NST test
framework.  NST is a unit test system which provides support for test
fixture data, stateful setup and cleanup of tests, grouping of tests,
and (we think!) a useful runtime interface.  Suggestions and comments
are welcome; a list of known bugs and infelicities concludes this
document.  The file \texttt{nst-nst.lisp} in this distribution holds
the NST tests for NST, and contains many examples (some of which we
have adapted to this document).

\subsection*{Contributors}
NST and this manual were written primarily by John
Maraist\footnote{Smart Information Flow Technologies, 211 North First
  Street, Suite 300, Minneapolis, MN 55401; \textsl{jmaraist} at
  \textsl{sift.info}.}.  Robert P.\ Goldman provided guidance,
comments and suggestions through the development.  Other contributors:
Mike Pelican, Steve Harp and Michael Atighetchi.
