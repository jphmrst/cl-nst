\section{Tests and test criteria}
Individual unit tests are encoded with the \texttt{def-test} form:
\input{../common/check-syntax}
%
The \texttt{SETUP}, \texttt{CLEANUP} and \texttt{FIXTURES} are just as
for test groups, but apply only to the one test.  The
\texttt{CRITERION} is a list or symbol specifying the properties which
should hold for the \texttt{FORM}s.

When there are no \texttt{SETUP}, \texttt{CLEANUP} or
\texttt{FIXTURES} arguments, the \texttt{NAME} may be given without
parentheses.  Likewise, any criterion consisting of a single symbol,
e.g.\ \texttt{(:pass)}, may be abbreviated as just the symbol without
the parentheses, e.g.\ \texttt{:pass}.

The \texttt{def-check} form is a deprecated synonym for
\texttt{def-test}.
