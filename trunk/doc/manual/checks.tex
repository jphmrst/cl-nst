\section{Checks}
\fbox{Reword} The
\texttt{def-check}\index{check}\index{def-check@\texttt{def-check}}
form allows a higher-level description of tests.  The basic syntactic
forms are:
\input{../common/check-syntax}
The \textit{setup}, \textit{cleanup} and \textit{fixtures} forms are
passed as-is to the underlying \texttt{def-test}, and work the same
way.  The \textit{criterion} is a list or symbol specifying the
properties which should hold for the \textit{forms}.  When there are
no \textit{setup}, \textit{cleanup} or \textit{fixtures} arguments,
the \textit{name} may be given without parentheses.  Likewise, any
criterion consisting of a single symbol, e.g.\ \texttt{(:pass)}, may
be abbreviated as just the symbol without the parentheses, e.g.\
\texttt{:pass}.

\fbox{UPDATE BELOW} Where this list and the list in getting-started
differ, the latter is almost certainly correct.  But this order is
better, re-ored getting-started.
