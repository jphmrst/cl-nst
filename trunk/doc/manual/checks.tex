\section{Tests and test criteria}
\label{sec:deftest}
Individual unit tests are encoded with the \texttt{def-test} form:
\input{../common/check-syntax}
%
The \texttt{SETUP}, \texttt{CLEANUP} and \texttt{FIXTURES} are just as
for test groups, but apply only to the one test.  The
\texttt{CRITERION} is a list or symbol specifying the properties which
should hold for the \texttt{FORM}s.

When a test is not enclosed within a group body, a group name must be
provided by the \texttt{GROUP} option.  When a test is enclosed within
a group body, the \texttt{GROUP} option is not required, but if
provided it must agree with the group name.

When there are no \texttt{SETUP}, \texttt{CLEANUP} or
\texttt{FIXTURES} arguments, the \texttt{NAME} may be given without
parentheses.  Likewise, any criterion consisting of a single symbol,
e.g.\ \texttt{(:pass)}, may be abbreviated as just the symbol without
the parentheses, e.g.\ \texttt{:pass}.

The \texttt{:documentation} form provides a documentation string in
the standard Lisp sense.  Since documentation strings are stored
against names, and since the same name can be used for several tests
(so long as they are all in different packages), documentation strings
on tests may not be particularly useful.

The \texttt{def-check} form is a deprecated synonym for
\texttt{def-test}.
