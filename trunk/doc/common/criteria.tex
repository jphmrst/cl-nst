\begin{criteriaGroup}{Criteria for multiple values}{
NST's approach to multiple values is stricter than Common Lisp's view
in the language itself.  In Lisp programs, additional returned values
are eminently ignorable; in fact some extra programming overhead is
required to access them.  However, in designing NST we draw a
distinction between \emph{using} a function on the one hand, and
\emph{designing} and \emph{testing} it on the other.  For example,
when using the \texttt{floor} function one often needs only the
quotient, and it is correspondingly easy to ignore the additional
argument which gives the remainder.  However, for the implementor of
\texttt{floor} it is important that both results be predictable and
verified.\vspace{\parskip}\\\hspace*{\parindent}NST encourages the
thoughtful, consistent design and correct implementation of functions
returning multiple values by enforcing that tested forms generating
multiple variables should be paired with criteria for multiple values.
\emph{Any mismatch between the quantity of values returned by an
  evaluation and the quantity of values expected by a criterion is
  interpreted as a test failure}.  Dually to the usage mode of Common
Lisp, NST requires the additional overhead of the
\texttt{:drop-values} criterion to simply ignore additional returned
values.}
