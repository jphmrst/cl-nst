* Running NST's jenkins script
To run a local version of NST's jenkins script, mimic the
=cadillac-jm.sh= and =beast-jm.sh= scripts.
 - Always define environment variables =NST_DIR= and =CLOSER_MOP_DIR=
   to where you have NST and Closer-to-MOP (respectively) stored.
 - The script looks for environment variables which indicate either:
   - The absolute path of Lisp platforms' executables.
   - That a particular platform should not be tested.
 - The variables which give pathnames to executables are:
   - NST_ALLEGRO_MIXEDCASE, for Allegro Common Lisp in "modern"
     mixed-case mode.
   - NST_ALLEGRO_UPCASE, for Allegro Common Lisp in classic
     case-insensitive, upper-case mode.
   - NST_ALLEGRO_MIXEDCASE8, for Allegro Common Lisp in "modern"
     mixed-case mode, limited to 8-bit characters.
   - NST_ALLEGRO_UPCASE8, for Allegro Common Lisp in classic
     case-insensitive, upper-case mode, limited to 8-bit characters.
   - NST_SBCL_UPCASE, for Steel Bank Common Lisp.
   - NST_CLISP_UPCASE, for GNU Clisp in classic case-insensitive,
     upper-case mode.
   - NST_CLISP_MIXEDCASE, for GNU Clisp in "modern" mixed-case mode,
     limited to 8-bit characters.
   - NST_CCL_UPCASE, for Clozure Common Lisp
 - The variables which indicate that a platform should be skipped are
   the above with SKIP_ prefixed.
 - End the wrapper script with a call to =./jenkins.perl=.
