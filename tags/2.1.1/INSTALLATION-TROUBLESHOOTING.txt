This file discusses tips on fixing problems obtaining, compiling, loading and running NST.

* Obtaining NST
  Please do let us know about any broken links, missing pages, or
  other problems downloading NST.  NST is available via different
  mechanisms; please do consider alternatives if one fails:
** Direct download
   (As of May 2010) NST is distributed from
   http://nst.maraist.org/download as a gzip'ped source tarball.
*** ASDF-install
    The source tarball is signed and listed on cliki.net, so NST is
    installable by the ASDF-install package.  Of course, if the web
    site is unavailable, this installation would also fail.
** Anonymous svn
   NST development is hosted by SIFT, LLC of Minneapolis.  The NST
   repository is configured for anonymous read-only access.  The main
   repository is located at https://svn.sift.info:3333/svn/nst/ , and
   has the standard svn top-level trunk/tags/branches structure.  To
   check out main development trunk into a local directory =nst-dev=,
   use:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
svn co https://svn.sift.info:3333/svn/nst/ nst-dev
#+END_EXAMPLE
   To export version 1.2.2 into a local directory =old-nst=, use:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
svn export https://svn.sift.info:3333/svn/nst/tags/1.2.2 old-nst
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Compiling and loading
** The core NST system
*** Loading NST's self-tests
    NST's tests are spread among several directories; use the following code to prepare your ASDF registry to load them in:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(let ((repos-dir "/PATH/TO/YOUR/NST/REPOS/"))
  (loop for dir in '(""
                     "test/"
                     "test/direct/"
                     "test/manual/"
                     "test/meta/"
                     "test/util/"
                     "test/asdf/masdfnst.asd") do
    (push (make-pathname :directory (concatenate 'string repos-dir dir))
          asdf:*central-registry*)))
(push (make-pathname :directory "/PATH/TO/YOUR/CLOSER-MOP/REPOS/")
      asdf:*central-registry*)
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Test construction
* Running NST
