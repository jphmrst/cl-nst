\section{Output to JUnit}

NST reports can be formatted as XML for use with JUnit, although the
API for this feature is underdeveloped.  The
\texttt{junit-results-by-group} function aligns test groups with Java
classes, and individual tests with \texttt{@Test} methods.
\begin{verbatim}
  (junit-results-by-group :verbose VERBOSE
                          :dir DIR :file FILE
                          :stream STREAM
                          :if-dir-does-not-exist BOOL
                          :if-file-exists BOOL)
\end{verbatim}
Either \texttt{:dir} and \texttt{:file} options, or the
\texttt{:stream} option, but not both, should be used to specify the
target for XML output; if none of the three options are given, the
function will write to \texttt{*standard-output*}.
