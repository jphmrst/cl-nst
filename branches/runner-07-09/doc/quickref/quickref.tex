  \LARGE Getting started with NST\footnote{This document was last
    updated for NST version 1.1.1.  Written by John Maraist, Smart
    Information Flow Technologies, 211 N.\ First St.\ Suite 300,

\section*{Overview}
\emph{Fixtures} are data structures and values which may be referred
to by name during testing.  NST provides the ability to use fixtures
across multiple tests and test groups, and to inject fixtures into the
runtime namespace for debugging.  Fixtures are defined using the
\texttt{def-fixture} form.

\emph{Groups} of tests can be associated with fixture sets, stateful
initiatization, and stateful cleanup.  Test groups are defined using
the \texttt{def-test-group} form.

Individual tests are declared within test groups using the
\texttt{def-test} form.

Examples of NST fixtures, groups and tests are available in
\textsl{self-test/core/simple-mnst.lisp}~.  The figure on the next
page shows the changes involved in using NST in a system definition.

\section*{Forms}
The \texttt{def-fixtures} form associates a sequence of names and
forms.
\input{../common/fixture-syntax}
with keyword arguments:
\begin{itemize}

\item\texttt{uses} gives fixtures assumed to also be used whenever
  this fixture is used.

\item\texttt{assumes} lists names assumed to be bound --- although not
  necessarily from the same source at each use of this fixture --- at
  the point of any use of this fixture.

\item\texttt{documentation} is a documentation string for the fixture
  set.

\item\texttt{inner} is the list of declarations to be made inside the
  let-binding of names of any use of this fixture.  Do not include the
  "declare" keyword here; NST adds these declarations to others,
  including a special declaration of all bound names.

\item\texttt{outer} is the list of declarations to be made outside the
  let-binding of names of any use of this fixture.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{def-test-group} form 
\input{../common/group-syntax}
defines a group of the given name, providing one instantiation of the
bindings of the given fixtures to each test.  Forms given with the
\texttt{setup} (respectively \texttt{cleanup}) option are run once,
before (after) any of the individual tests.  Forms given with the
\texttt{each-setup} (respectively \texttt{each-cleanup}) option are
run before (after) each individual tests.

The \texttt{def-test} form defines a single named test:
\input{../common/check-syntax}
The \texttt{:setup}, \texttt{:cleanup} and \texttt{:fixture} options
are as above, but apply to only this test (and note that for multiple
forms for the first two must be wrapped in a \texttt{progn}).  NST's
built-in criteria are listed below; see the manual for a discussion of
the forms which define new criteria.

\section*{Criteria}
Criteria forms have the following structure:
\begin{verbatim}
  (CRITERIA-NAME ARG ARG ... ARG)
\end{verbatim}
but a no-argument criterion use \texttt{(NAME)} can be abbreviated as
\texttt{NAME}.  NST's built-in criteria include:
\def\criteriaGroup#1#2{\par\textbf{#1.}\begin{criteria}}
\def\secText#1{}
\def\endcriteriaGroup{\end{criteria}}
\def\criteriaDoc#1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8{\criterion{#2}{#3}{#5}{#4}}
\def\noExpl{}
\def\hasExpl#1{}
\def\manualOrRef#1#2{#2}
\input{../common/criteria}

\section*{Interactive debugging}
NST defines a REPL alias \texttt{:nst} under Allegro CL.  The general
form of commands is:
\begin{verbatim}
  :nst COMMAND ARGUMENTS
\end{verbatim}
Use \mbox{\texttt{:nst :help}} for a list of commands, and
\mbox{\texttt{:nst COMMAND :help}} for details about individual
commands.

\section*{ASDF}
NST tests can be referenced from ASDF systems, allowing easy
invocation to unit tests relevant to a system.  The system
\textsl{self-test/masdfnst.asd} gives an example of its use.  The
snippet below highlights the difference between non-NST and
NST-oriented ASDF system declarations.
\texttt{\small

\\;; this file.
