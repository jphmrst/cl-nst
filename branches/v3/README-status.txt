Working now on the status reporting.  Want something in place that
shows results even if it's not perfect.

Open tickets:

  #30  Context-preserving error reporting scheme
  #31  Wrap instance-based run methods in eql-methods on group and test names
  #32  Redesign interaction schemes
  #36  Document class/method setup
  #33  Add SBCL compatibility

Add ticket about anonymous fixtures.

Also need to comment and doc-comment everything that's in place.
