#summary What few coding conventions we follow

= Coding conventions =

I like the [https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lispguide.xml Google Lisp styleguide], and have even sort-of started to follow it.  And this short list:

_Avoid controls in `format` strings._  The more complicated structures in `format`'s strings are hard to read, difficult to maintain, and not consistent from implementation to implementation.  We do not use `~<`, `~[`, `~^`, `~*` (nor any variation of these with prefix arguments), or any but the very simplest uses of `~{`.  Use the corresponding pretty-printer macros and functions.

_Use named closures instead of `function` or `#'`._ On platforms where they are supported, named closures are useful for debugging.  NST either imports an implementation's `named-macro` into package `:nst`, defines a macro to reference an implementation's differently-named facility, or defines a trivial macro for platforms which do not support named closures.
